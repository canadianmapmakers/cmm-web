Canadian Map Makers craft high quality beautiful maps, custom designed to your requirements. We create everything from small location maps through to large and complex topographical maps for outdoor recreation use. Let us help you with your next mapping project, no matter how large or small!

Since starting business in 2013 we have designed 100’s of maps of every type and size, including detailed topographical maps, wall maps, maps for guidebooks, event maps, digital maps, 3D maps and tourist pamphlets. Whatever your mapping requirements, contact us to see what we can do for you.

Working with our Partner (Alliance Printing in Coquitlam) we can arrange to have your new map designs printed to your exact requirements. Large or small, one offs or high volume offset print runs, we can arrange all that, printed onto a variety of print media (regular paper, card, glossy stock, waterproof stock, sintra for wall mounted, laminated and more).

Canadian Map Makers produces our own local maps for hiking and biking in the mountains around Port Moody, Coquitlam and Maple Ridge:

### Pricing

After understanding your exact requirements, we will calculate the amount of work required to complete your job. From that we will provide a **fixed quote** based on our hourly design rate of $50/hr. Printing costs (if applicable) are quoted separately after consulting with our printing partner. All quotes are subject to local applicable sales taxes. For design work, there is a minimum charge of $200.

Project pricing will vary greatly depending on the complexity of the design and the printing requirements. Offset printing is only viable for larger quantities because of the setup costs. Generally, only quantities greater than 2,000 tend to be viable. The prices below provide a **very rough** guideline for what a project of **medium complexity** might be:

* One off large print for wall mounting: $250 - $350 – printing only.

* Design of a large format wall map: $1,200 - $1,600.

* Maps for guidebooks: $100 per map for larger quantities.

* Pamphlet design with maps and graphic design: $1,500 - $3,000.

* Full-size double-sided topo map (as per our own publications): $5,000 - $9,000.

* Simple map for a technical publication: $400.

* Race event map: $800.

* Small topographical map with limited scope: $400 - $800.
